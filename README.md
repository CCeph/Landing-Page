# Landing-Page

In this project, I am going to be creating a landing page based on two images. The first image shows how the completed web page should roughly look while the second image provides some of the colors and fonts used. The images are included in the img folder.

This project will demonstrate my ability to utilize basic HTML, CSS and flexbox skills to create a web page from scratch when provided with a design. It should also display an improvement in my commit messages.
